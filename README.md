# README Generator 

## Description
This README Generator is a simple tool that helps you quickly create README files for your projects. It’s a command-line app that asks you a few questions about your project like what it’s called, how to use it, how to set it up, and how you want others to contribute. After you answer the questions, it automatically puts together a README file with all the details you provided, organized into sections like Description, Installation, and Usage. It even adds a license badge based on what you choose. This tool is great for anyone who wants to make their project look good on GitHub without spending too much time on the documentation.
